# DWS Coding Standard
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dominionenterprises/dws-coding-standard.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dominionenterprises/dws-coding-standard)

A fairly complete [http://www.squizlabs.com/php-codesniffer](PHP_CodeSniffer) coding standard.  See the [src/standard.md](standard document) to
see what "sniffs" are enforced.

## Composer

This standard is meant to be used in a project using [http://getcomposer.org](Composer).  It can be added to your project's composer.json as follows:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "dominionenterprises/dws-coding-standard": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

Then to use it, you can run the following (or add to your build process):

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=$(pwd)/vendor/dominionenterprises/dws-coding-standard/DWS YOUR_FILES_AND_DIRECTORIES
```
